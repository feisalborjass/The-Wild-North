For this assignment, we had to create a game in a group setting. Working with
a small team of five, we had to make a full Object Oriented game with full 
art. We broke into smaller teams to ensure that each part of the project was
done with care and with close attention to detail.

The Wild North is coded in Python version 3.4.4 using the Pydev interpreter 
3.0 and Pygame 1.9.2

To play the game you will require a keyboard with arrow keys and a mouse.

NOTE: THE PROGRAM WILL AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME THAT PYGAME IS INSTALLED ON THE 
      USER'S COMPUTER AND THE USER WILL HAVE CONTROLS AVAILABLE TO THEM!

After you download the main game's ZIP file, you can open up Eclipse or IDLE 
and make menu selection. If you're not interested in credits or help, then 
just click Play and get going!

The Team did have some restrictions that may have limited the look or 
response of the game. For example, we could only use Python, Pygame, Pydev 
and the resources that came with them. We weren't allowed to ship the game 
with any external libraries or programs. Also, the game must be runable in 
IDLE to get a proper mark.

There is one known error: The highscore is only saved in the instance of the
program that it was achieved in, meaning that it does not save between
closing one version and opening another.

First, ensure that you have Python and the latest compatible version of 
Pygame installed on your computer. Then, open your IDE and load all game 
files (listed in "Additional Files") including all of the art. Once you have 
done this, open the program and press one of the buttons on the screen. All 
you do then is use the appropriate keys for the screen that you are on and 
enjoy. If you wish to stop playing (why tho?) then simply die (if you are 
already in the main game), and click quit. Or you can click the 'x' in the 
top right corner of the screen.
